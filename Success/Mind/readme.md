**Interviewer:** How disappointed are you?

**Kobe:** Well, you know, I just hate losing. You know, it's a tough loss. Uh, you know, they played  better.  You have to get ready for the off season. Next season for us starts right now.

**Interviewer:** Can you assess exactly what went wrong? 

**Kobe:** I mean, we have a million excuses that we could go to. Fact of the matter is, we're not going to make any. They played better than we did in the series. We had opportunities to win it. So we have to regroup. Like I said, next season starts right now and we will come back next season to play.

**Interviewer:** How much harder will you wear working this off season now to get back to the Championship?

**Kobe:** **I'll push myself to exhaustion.** 

**Interviewer:** We thank you for your time.

[The Secret To Becoming Mentally Strong - Jordan Peterson Motivation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIEKfr9CaZA)

**Starts from [15:47](https://youtu.be/fIEKfr9CaZA?t=951)**

I figured something out that i thought i'd tell you about this took me like 30 years to figure out and i figured it out on this tour so there's this old idea you know that you have to rescue your father from the belly of the whale right from some monster that's deep in the abyss you see that pinocchio for example but it's a very common idea and i figured out why that is i think.

Imagine that we already know from a clinical perspective that you know if you set out a path towards a goal which you want to do because you need a goal and you need a path because that provides you with positive emotion right so you set up something as valuable so that implies a hierarchy you set up something as valuable you decide that you're going to do that instead of other things so that's kind of a sacrifice because you're sacrificing everything else to pursue that 

Then you experience a fair bit of positive emotion and meaning as you watch yourself move towards the goal and so the implication of that is the the better the goal the the more full and rich your experience is going to be when you pursue it so that's one of the reasons of that's one of the reasons for developing a vision and for fleshing yourself out philosophically because you want to aim at the highest goal that you can manage okay so you do that and then what you'll find is that as you move towards the goal there are certain things that that that you have to accomplish that frighten you 

Maybe you have to learn to be a better speaker, a better writer, a better thinker, you have to be better to people around you or you have to learn some new skills and you're afraid of that whatever because it's going to stretch you if you if you pursue a goal and it's and so that'll put you up against challenges 

All the clinical data indicates well the opposite of safe spaces as jonathan height has been pointing out that what you want to do when you identify something that someone is avoiding that they need to do because they're afraid you have them voluntary con voluntarily confronted.

And so you break it down what you try to do if you're a behavior therapist is you break down the thing they're avoiding into smaller and smaller pieces until you find a piece that's small enough so they'll do it and it doesn't really matter as long as they start it you know then they can put the next piece on in the next piece and what happens is they don't get less afraid exactly they get brave it's like there's more of them you can and here's why so imagine you do something new and that's informative right there's information in the action and then you can incorporate that information and turn it into a skill and turn it into a transformation of your perceptions so there's more to you because you've tried something new

So that's one thing but the second thing is and there's good biological evidence for this now that if you put yourself in a new situation then new genes code for new proteins and build new neural structures and new nervous system structures same thing happens to some degree when you work out right because your your muscles are responding to the load but your nervous system does that too

So you imagine that there's a lot of potential you locked in your genetic code and then if you put yourself in a new situation then then the stress that's the situational stress that's produced by that particular situation unlocks those genes and then builds new parts of you and so that's very cool because who knows how much there is locked inside of you okay 

So now, here's the idea. So let's assume that that scales as you take on heavier and heavier loads that more and more of you you get more and more informed because you're doing more and more difficult things but more and more of you gets unlocked and so then what that would imply is that if you got to the point where you could look at the darkest things so that would be the abyss right that would be the deepest abyss if you could look at the harshest things like the most brutal parts of the suffering of the world and the malevolence of people and society if you could look that look at that straight and and directly that that would turn you on maximally 

That's the idea of rescuing your father because imagine that you're like the potential composite of of all your all the ancestral wisdom that's locked inside of you biologically but that's not going to come out at all unless you stress yourself unless you unless you challenge yourself and the bigger the challenge you take on the more that's going to turn on and so that as you take on a broader and broader range of challenges and you push yourself harder then more and more of what you could be turns on and that's equivalent to transforming yourself into the ancestral father into all because you're you're like the what would you call it you're the consequence of all these living beings that have come before you and that's all part of your biological potentiality and then if you can push yourself then all that clicks on and that turns you into who you could be that's and that's the re-representation of that positive ancestral father so that's why you rescue your father from the belly of the beast.

The full quote here:

‚ÄúWhen you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.

That‚Äôs a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is ‚Äì everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That‚Äôs maybe the most important thing. It‚Äôs to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you‚Äôre just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.

I think that‚Äôs very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you‚Äôll want to change life and make it better, cause it‚Äôs kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you‚Äôll never be the same again.‚Äù

## Jordan Peterson 

I'm a clinical psychologist and here's one of the things you do to make people less afraid.

You don't make the world **safer.** What you do is, people tell you what they're afraid of and then you break it into little bits so that they can go confront them.

So, maybe they're afraid of going to a party and you break that down, you say, well do you know how to introduce yourself and they said well i know i don't really know how to shake someone's hand and so then you practice having them shake their hand and introduce themselves because maybe they weren't taught by that by their half-witted parents when they were when they were young because they were ignored.

So then, you say well maybe you can go to a party for half an hour and all you have to do is introduce yourself to two people and we'll call that success.

And you build up their confidence and their confidence one step at a time and what happens the the clinical literature indicates quite clearly is:

**You don't make people less anxious by doing that you make them braver it's not the same thing you don't make the world and its horrors smaller you make the person and their their their capacity to deal with horror larger you encourage them, you strengthen them**

I will give you a practical piece of a suggestion on that. This is another thing you can do in your own household.

This is so useful, man, if you get good at doing this your life will get so much better, you can't believe it.

Watch the people around you and whenever they do anything that you would like to see repeated on a regular basis:

"Tell them exactly what they did in detail, with you, know be positive about it obviously and just indicate that you noticed."

[Protocol](https://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M?t=2170)

1- Get Alert - 15 deep inhales followed by exhales
Will deploy adrenaline and get you alert. 

2- Get Focused - use white noise before learning as it will increase focus, also stare at your target üéØ (the screen) for 10 to 60 seconds with no blinking, this will prime your focus. 

3- Generate repetitions. 

4- Expect and Embrace Errors - mistakes are inevitable. also, they increase focus as your brain searches for errors. 

5- Micro Rest - Incorporate inter practice rest of 10 to 30 seconds in the studying session randomly as it will greatly enhances speed and depth of learning, don't obsess over optimal number and duration, don't move at all during rest. 

6- Use Random Intermittent Reward - Te best reward sometimes is no reward, never expect rewards don't work for them. But have them randomly. 

7- Limit learning sessions to 90 minutes - 2-3 hours apart in between sessions, focus is hard work and doesn't feel necessarily good in the body.

8- Incorporate Non Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) - For 10 to 30 minutes After session immediately or after hours e.g: reveri hypnosis, Yoga nidra, a nap.

9- Get deep sleep that night - After learning as they increase plasticity . If napping disturbs sleep at night, don't use it as an NSDR or if you do limit it to 10 minutes.

[ Jordan Peterson - Do What is Meaningful, Not What is Expedient ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY)

The first thing I would say is well you should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful.
But you should be more afraid of staying where you are if it's making you miserable.

It's like the first thing you want to do is dispense with the idea that you get to have any any permanent security
outside of your ability to contend and adapt.

..

You're paying a price by sitting there being miserable.

You might say well the devil I know is better than the one I don't it's like
don't be so sure of that the clock is ticking yeah and if you're miserable in
your job now and you change nothing in five years you'll be much more miserable
and you'll be a lot older.
