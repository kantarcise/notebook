[Death](https://youtu.be/sdvzYtgmIjs?t=4166)

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.

Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

[Choosing your future](https://youtu.be/8Fd06U-3TAY?t=402)

Not only it is important for you to know that it is possible for you to choose your future, but it is necessary.

It is neccessary that you get the energy drainers out of your life. People who do not want anything.

It is neccessary to know that everybody won't see it. 

Everybody won't join you. Everybody won't have the vision.

A lot people complain but they do not want to do anything about their situation.

Even if noone else sees it for me, I must see it for myself.

## Tony Robbins - On Leadership

**Leadership** is a skill of influence and it is one of the most important skills you can have.

It is not a position, it is a skill.

Other people do not have to follow you to be a leader.

You have to live your life on your terms. 

Can you influence yourself?

Ideas will die on your lips unless you can become a person of influence.



### What is "destroying the limitations of your own mind" mean?

Businesses are bottlenecked by skills or believes of the leader.

When you allow the environment to control your psychology, you are not going to win.

When you believed you tried everything possible, if you think you are maxed out, you are finished.

The San Jose - found the gold after 27 years of search.

You have to believe 3 things:

- There is treasure out there.

- I will find it.
 
- It is worth it.

Changing the psychology of the leader, is what will change a business really fast.



### What are the mechanics of changing your limitations?

People are not one way. We are reflection of the state we are living in.

Overwhelmed, tired vs committed, passionate, determined.

These are night and day different people.

You got to learn how to change your state.

If someone gets in a slump, you show someone a video of his/her best.

The movement, the energy is different.

2-Minute Power Pose: 20% More Testosterone, 18% Less Kortizole.

Training yourself to be in a peak state every day. That is what great leaders need to do.




### Can anyone be a leader?

What is the scareset resource we have in our society today, is great leaders.

Anyone can be a leader that they decided to become masterful in.

You could be a leader of your own life.

You should be the leader of your family.

It is a skill, it starts by having something that you are committed to that is larger than yourself, a vision that is bigger than yourself.

If there is a large enough vision, if you have enough passion for that vision, than you are going to have enough drive to actually start to execute on that vision.

Life is not zero sum. My leadership does not take away from your leadership.

As a leader, what will free you? Recruiting other leaders, training other leaders.

What does a leader do? They get the result. They find a way to victory. They find a way to make breakthrough with teams.


###  How to influence?

In order to influence people, you have to know what already influences them.

You cannot influence people the way you get influenced.

There are 2 things that influence everyone.

As a leader:

- Have to know how to change other peoples states.

- Blueprints ? What are they values? What do they believe? What do they fear?

### How to change?

If you want to produce change, you have to study what works.

Success leaves clues.

You could save yourself a decade, by spending a few weeks modeling somebody that strong.

### Improvement?

You have to retool yourself.

The opportunity for self education is there.

pSYCHOLOGY IS SUCH A WEIRD THING.

I am going to do what everybody else does, I am angry that it does not work anymore.

TO

This is the greatest time to be alive if you are learning, growing and you are developing valuable skills.

Where are the skillsets are valued in the marketplace.

How do I work harder on myself than anything else?



Progress == Happiness

Enterpreneurs love risk.

### Strategies

You do not have to be the originator of an idea. 

You can see a model that works and just execute better than someone else.

See something that works to bring it somewhere else.

Why not you?

I have to break pattern for you.

Failure is learning. It is a speedbump on the way to success.

When you permenantly give up, that is failure.

## Andrej Karpathy - On Running a Company

[How does Elon runs companies?](https://youtu.be/c3b-JASoPi0?t=969)

Elon runs this company is an extremely unique style I don't actually think that people appreciate how unique it is.

It's like even hard to describe I don't even know where to start but it's like a very unique different thing. 

I like to say that he runs the biggest startups. 

Number one is like so he likes very small strong highly technical teams. I would say companies by default grow and they get large, Elon was always like a force against growth.

I would have to work and expend effort to hire people. And then the other thing is at big companies usually you want um it's really hard to get rid of low performers.

I think Elon is very friendly to by default getting rid of low performers, so I actually had to fight for people to keep them on the team.

Because he would by default want to remove people. So keep a small strong highly technical team, no middle management that is kind of like non-technical for sure.

Number two is kind of like is The Vibes of how everything runs and how it feels when he sort of like walks into the office.

He wants it to be a vibrant place, people are walking around, they're pacing around, they're working on exciting stuff, they're charting something, they're coding.

He doesn't like stagnation. 

He doesn't like large meetings, he always encourages people to like leave meetings if they're not being useful.

So actually you see this or you know it's a large meeting and some if you're not contributing and you're not learning, just walk out.

And this is like fully encouraged and I think this is something that you don't normally see. 

So I think like Vibes is like a second big lever.

I think a lot of bigger companies they like pamper employees. I think like there's much less of that.

It's like the culture of it is you're there to do your best technical work. And there's the intensity and so on. 

And I think maybe the last one that is very unique and very interesting and very strange is just how connected he is to the team.

So usually a CEO of a company is like a remote person, five layers up who talks to their VPS, who talk to their you know reports and directors and eventually you talk to your manager.

It's not how Elon runs companies. 

He will come to the office he will talk to the engineers. Many of the meetings that we had were like 50 people in the room with Elon and uh he talks directly to the engineers.

He doesn't want to talk just to the VPS and the directors. So normally people would talk spend like 99% of the time maybe talking to the VPS.

He spends maybe 50% of the time and he just wants to talk to the engineers. 

So if the team is small and strong, then engineers and the code are the source of Truth.

And so they have the source of Truth. Not some manager.

He wants to talk to them to understand the actual state of things and what should be done to improve it.

So I would say like the degree to which he's connected with the team and not something remote is also unique. Also just like his large hammer and his willingness to exercise it within the organization.

Maybe if he talks to the engineers and they bring up that you know what's blocking you okay I just I don't have enough gpus to run my thing.

And he's like oh okay and if he hears that twice he's going to be like okay this is a problem.

So like what is our timeline and when when you don't have satisfying answers he's like "okay I want to talk to the person in charge of the GPU cluster" and like someone dials the phone and he's just like "okay double the cluster right now."

Like let's have a meeting tomorrow from now on send me daily updates until cluster is twice the size.

Then they push back and they're like okay well we have this procurement set up, we have this timeline and Nvidia says that we don't have enough GPU's gpus and it will take six months or something.

And then you get a rise of an eyebrow and then he's like okay I want to talk to Jensen.

He just kind of like removes bottlenecks so I think the extent to which he's extremely involved and removes bottlenecks, and applies his hammer.

I think is also like not appreciated.

So I think there's like a lot of these kinds of aspects that are very unique I would say and very interesting.

And honestly like going to a normal company outside of that is you like definitely miss aspects of that.

How do you define success? How do you measure results? How do you understand failure? What is important and what is not important. These definitions help everyone. 

- Have very low expectations. [Link](https://youtu.be/cEg8cOx7UZk?t=2173)

## Sam Altman - What I Wish Someone Had Told Me

- Optimism, obsession, self-belief, raw horsepower and personal connections are how things get started.

- Cohesive teams, the right combination of calmness and urgency, and unreasonable commitment are how things get finished. Long-term orientation is in short supply; try not to worry about what people think in the short term, which will get easier over time.

- It is easier for a team to do a hard thing that really matters than to do an easy thing that doesn‚Äôt really matter; audacious ideas motivate people.

- Incentives are superpowers; set them carefully.

- Concentrate your resources on a small number of high-conviction bets; this is easy to say but evidently hard to do. You can delete more stuff than you think.

- Communicate clearly and concisely.

- Fight lies and bureaucracy every time you see it and get other people to fight it too. Do not let the org chart get in the way of people working productively together.

- Outcomes are what count; don‚Äôt let good process excuse bad results.

- Spend more time recruiting. Take risks on high-potential people with a fast rate of improvement. Look for evidence of getting stuff done in addition to intelligence.

- Superstars are even more valuable than they seem, but you have to evaluate people on their net impact on the performance of the organization.

- Fast iteration can make up for a lot; it‚Äôs usually ok to be wrong if you iterate quickly. Plans should be measured in decades, execution should be measured in weeks.

- Don‚Äôt fight the business equivalent of the laws of physics.

- Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.

- Scale often has surprising emergent properties.

- Compounding exponentials are magic. In particular, you really want to build a business that gets a compounding advantage with scale.

- Get back up and keep going.

- Working with great people is one of the best parts of life.

I figured something out that i thought i'd tell you about this took me like 30 years to figure out and i figured it out on this tour so there's this old idea you know that you have to rescue your father from the belly of the whale right from some monster that's deep in the abyss you see that pinocchio for example but it's a very common idea and i figured out why that is i think.

Imagine that we already know from a clinical perspective that you know if you set out a path towards a goal which you want to do because you need a goal and you need a path because that provides you with positive emotion right so you set up something as valuable so that implies a hierarchy you set up something as valuable you decide that you're going to do that instead of other things so that's kind of a sacrifice because you're sacrificing everything else to pursue that 

Then you experience a fair bit of positive emotion and meaning as you watch yourself move towards the goal and so the implication of that is the the better the goal the the more full and rich your experience is going to be when you pursue it so that's one of the reasons of that's one of the reasons for developing a vision and for fleshing yourself out philosophically because you want to aim at the highest goal that you can manage okay so you do that and then what you'll find is that as you move towards the goal there are certain things that that that you have to accomplish that frighten you 

Maybe you have to learn to be a better speaker, a better writer, a better thinker, you have to be better to people around you or you have to learn some new skills and you're afraid of that whatever because it's going to stretch you if you if you pursue a goal and it's and so that'll put you up against challenges 

All the clinical data indicates well the opposite of safe spaces as jonathan height has been pointing out that what you want to do when you identify something that someone is avoiding that they need to do because they're afraid you have them voluntary con voluntarily confronted.

And so you break it down what you try to do if you're a behavior therapist is you break down the thing they're avoiding into smaller and smaller pieces until you find a piece that's small enough so they'll do it and it doesn't really matter as long as they start it you know then they can put the next piece on in the next piece and what happens is they don't get less afraid exactly they get brave it's like there's more of them you can and here's why so imagine you do something new and that's informative right there's information in the action and then you can incorporate that information and turn it into a skill and turn it into a transformation of your perceptions so there's more to you because you've tried something new

So that's one thing but the second thing is and there's good biological evidence for this now that if you put yourself in a new situation then new genes code for new proteins and build new neural structures and new nervous system structures same thing happens to some degree when you work out right because your your muscles are responding to the load but your nervous system does that too

So you imagine that there's a lot of potential you locked in your genetic code and then if you put yourself in a new situation then then the stress that's the situational stress that's produced by that particular situation unlocks those genes and then builds new parts of you and so that's very cool because who knows how much there is locked inside of you okay 

So now, here's the idea. So let's assume that that scales as you take on heavier and heavier loads that more and more of you you get more and more informed because you're doing more and more difficult things but more and more of you gets unlocked and so then what that would imply is that if you got to the point where you could look at the darkest things so that would be the abyss right that would be the deepest abyss if you could look at the harshest things like the most brutal parts of the suffering of the world and the malevolence of people and society if you could look that look at that straight and and directly that that would turn you on maximally 

That's the idea of rescuing your father because imagine that you're like the potential composite of of all your all the ancestral wisdom that's locked inside of you biologically but that's not going to come out at all unless you stress yourself unless you unless you challenge yourself and the bigger the challenge you take on the more that's going to turn on and so that as you take on a broader and broader range of challenges and you push yourself harder then more and more of what you could be turns on and that's equivalent to transforming yourself into the ancestral father into all because you're you're like the what would you call it you're the consequence of all these living beings that have come before you and that's all part of your biological potentiality and then if you can push yourself then all that clicks on and that turns you into who you could be that's and that's the re-representation of that positive ancestral father so that's why you rescue your father from the belly of the beast.

The full quote here:

‚ÄúWhen you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.

That‚Äôs a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is ‚Äì everything around you that you call life, was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

The minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That‚Äôs maybe the most important thing. It‚Äôs to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you‚Äôre just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.

I think that‚Äôs very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you‚Äôll want to change life and make it better, cause it‚Äôs kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you‚Äôll never be the same again.‚Äù

## Jordan Peterson 

I'm a clinical psychologist and here's one of the things you do to make people less afraid.

You don't make the world **safer.** What you do is, people tell you what they're afraid of and then you break it into little bits so that they can go confront them.

So, maybe they're afraid of going to a party and you break that down, you say, well do you know how to introduce yourself and they said well i know i don't really know how to shake someone's hand and so then you practice having them shake their hand and introduce themselves because maybe they weren't taught by that by their half-witted parents when they were when they were young because they were ignored.

So then, you say well maybe you can go to a party for half an hour and all you have to do is introduce yourself to two people and we'll call that success.

And you build up their confidence and their confidence one step at a time and what happens the the clinical literature indicates quite clearly is:

**You don't make people less anxious by doing that you make them braver it's not the same thing you don't make the world and its horrors smaller you make the person and their their their capacity to deal with horror larger you encourage them, you strengthen them**

I will give you a practical piece of a suggestion on that. This is another thing you can do in your own household.

This is so useful, man, if you get good at doing this your life will get so much better, you can't believe it.

Watch the people around you and whenever they do anything that you would like to see repeated on a regular basis:

"Tell them exactly what they did in detail, with you, know be positive about it obviously and just indicate that you noticed."

[Protocol](https://youtu.be/Oo7hQapFe3M?t=2170)

1- Get Alert - 15 deep inhales followed by exhales
Will deploy adrenaline and get you alert. 

2- Get Focused - use white noise before learning as it will increase focus, also stare at your target üéØ (the screen) for 10 to 60 seconds with no blinking, this will prime your focus. 

3- Generate repetitions. 

4- Expect and Embrace Errors - mistakes are inevitable. also, they increase focus as your brain searches for errors. 

5- Micro Rest - Incorporate inter practice rest of 10 to 30 seconds in the studying session randomly as it will greatly enhances speed and depth of learning, don't obsess over optimal number and duration, don't move at all during rest. 

6- Use Random Intermittent Reward - Te best reward sometimes is no reward, never expect rewards don't work for them. But have them randomly. 

7- Limit learning sessions to 90 minutes - 2-3 hours apart in between sessions, focus is hard work and doesn't feel necessarily good in the body.

8- Incorporate Non Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR) - For 10 to 30 minutes After session immediately or after hours e.g: reveri hypnosis, Yoga nidra, a nap.

9- Get deep sleep that night - After learning as they increase plasticity . If napping disturbs sleep at night, don't use it as an NSDR or if you do limit it to 10 minutes.

[ Jordan Peterson - Do What is Meaningful, Not What is Expedient ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a28j1G5OUqY)

The first thing I would say is well you should be afraid of taking risks and pursuing something meaningful.
But you should be more afraid of staying where you are if it's making you miserable.

It's like the first thing you want to do is dispense with the idea that you get to have any any permanent security
outside of your ability to contend and adapt.

..

You're paying a price by sitting there being miserable.

You might say well the devil I know is better than the one I don't it's like
don't be so sure of that the clock is ticking yeah and if you're miserable in
your job now and you change nothing in five years you'll be much more miserable
and you'll be a lot older.

[Growth Without Goals - Patrick O'Shaughnessy](https://github.com/kantarcise/notebook/blob/master/Success/Mind/growth_without_goals.md)

**Man lives by time. Inventing the future has been his favorite game of escape.**
**We think that changes in ourselves can come about in time, that order in ourselves can be**
**built up little by little, added to day by day. But time doesn‚Äôt bring order or peace, so we**
**must stop thinking in terms of gradualness. This means that there is no**
**tomorrow for us to be peaceful in. We have to be orderly on the instant.**

This was a passage from Jiddu Krishnamurti - Freedom From the Known.

Great habits and practices make a great and successful life. Cultivate those and the rest will take care of itself.
