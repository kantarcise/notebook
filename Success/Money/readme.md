This alone needs a lot of thinking about.

"You have to learn anything you want to learn."

Reading complex books and the confusion comes along with it, is just simply pump for your mind muscles.

There is nothing like building something.

It was much more fun before it was 6 figures.

Enjoy the process.

[ Take Aim, Even Badly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwGDnSWmqhM)

I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis. Write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that.

Because they don't think I mean that, because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche at all.

You're a terrible writer, but if someone put a gun to your head and said you have to have your hundred page thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot you. 
But I don't care how terrible it is.

You would sit down and write it.

And the thing is, then you have it. Right? Then you have something. Then you can fix it.

You can iterate and fix it.

That bad first draft that's the most valuable thing. And so that's what you need, you need a bad first draft of yourself.

[REPROGRAM your mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ySuYdJ0H4s)

“Start today,” Alex says. “Read books. Do the stuff that’s in the books. Take advice from rich people on how to be rich. Pick a spouse who makes you feel
awesome about working. Fail once, try again. Think the world is unfair and act accordingly. Never blame your circumstances; thank your circumstances for
making you who you are.”

“Instead of complaining, do something,” Alex continues. “Expect no one to save you except for yourself. Value your opinion over those of other people. Seek
out discomfort. Tolerate nothing but excellence. Make promises, keep promises. Wait for the worst conditions, wait for imperfect conditions and act anyways
on what you want. Avoid working on the stuff that doesn’t matter. Work on the things that matter most. Ignore the rest.”

“Say you’re going to do something and then do it. Do what no one else is doing. Do your best and make it above what it takes to be successful. Talk less,
do more. Start something new today and keep at it until you are good. Do it so long that it would be unreasonable for you to be bad. Don’t believe what
other people think about you more than you believe what you think about yourself. Be irreplaceable. Find something that works and don’t stop doing it.”

“Keep doing it until you are bored out of your mind because you are so good at doing that thing that works. Hire smart people. Assume that you are always
wrong and be willing to learn. Make money and spend less than you make. And that is the 28 rules of poverty [from Charlie Munger] flipped on its head. And
you can take that information and make your own conclusions about where that’ll take you.
