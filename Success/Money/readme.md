This alone needs a lot of thinking about.

"You have to learn anything you want to learn."

Reading complex books and the confusion comes along with it, is just simply pump for your mind muscles.

There is nothing like building something.

It was much more fun before it was 6 figures.

Enjoy the process.

[ Take Aim, Even Badly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwGDnSWmqhM)

I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis. Write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that.

Because they don't think I mean that, because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche at all.

You're a terrible writer, but if someone put a gun to your head and said you have to have your hundred page thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot you. 
But I don't care how terrible it is.

You would sit down and write it.

And the thing is, then you have it. Right? Then you have something. Then you can fix it.

You can iterate and fix it.

That bad first draft that's the most valuable thing. And so that's what you need, you need a bad first draft of yourself.
