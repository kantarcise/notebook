[ Take Aim, Even Badly ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwGDnSWmqhM)

I tell my students when they're doing their thesis master's thesis. Write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that.

Because they don't think I mean that, because it sounds like a cliche in some sense. It's not a cliche at all.

You're a terrible writer, but if someone put a gun to your head and said you have to have your hundred page thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot you. 
But I don't care how terrible it is.

You would sit down and write it.

And the thing is, then you have it. Right? Then you have something. Then you can fix it.

You can iterate and fix it.

That bad first draft that's the most valuable thing. And so that's what you need, you need a bad first draft of yourself.

[REPROGRAM your mind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ySuYdJ0H4s)

“Start today,” Alex says. “Read books. Do the stuff that’s in the books. Take advice from rich people on how to be rich. Pick a spouse who makes you feel
awesome about working. Fail once, try again. Think the world is unfair and act accordingly. Never blame your circumstances; thank your circumstances for
making you who you are.”

“Instead of complaining, do something,” Alex continues. “Expect no one to save you except for yourself. Value your opinion over those of other people. Seek
out discomfort. Tolerate nothing but excellence. Make promises, keep promises. Wait for the worst conditions, wait for imperfect conditions and act anyways
on what you want. Avoid working on the stuff that doesn’t matter. Work on the things that matter most. Ignore the rest.”

“Say you’re going to do something and then do it. Do what no one else is doing. Do your best and make it above what it takes to be successful. Talk less,
do more. Start something new today and keep at it until you are good. Do it so long that it would be unreasonable for you to be bad. Don’t believe what
other people think about you more than you believe what you think about yourself. Be irreplaceable. Find something that works and don’t stop doing it.”

“Keep doing it until you are bored out of your mind because you are so good at doing that thing that works. Hire smart people. Assume that you are always
wrong and be willing to learn. Make money and spend less than you make. And that is the 28 rules of poverty [from Charlie Munger] flipped on its head. And
you can take that information and make your own conclusions about where that’ll take you.

[Here is how you become rich.](https://www.nightingale.com/articles/success-a-worthy-destination/)

I like to compare human beings with ships, as Carlyle used to do. It’s estimated that about 95 percent can be compared to ships without rudders, subject to
every shift of wind and tide. They’re helplessly adrift, and while they fondly hope that they will one day drift into some rich and bustling port, for
every narrow harbor entrance, there are 1,000 miles of rocky coastline. The chances of their drifting into port are 1,000 to 1 against them. Our state
lottery is a tax on such people. So are the slot machines in Las Vegas and Atlantic City. Someone wins from time to time to be sure, but the odds are still
there … stacked steeply against them.

But the 5 percent who have taken the time and exercised the discipline to climb into the driver’s seat of their lives, who’ve decided upon a challenging
goal to reach and have fully committed themselves to reaching it, sail straight and far across the deep oceans of life, reaching one port after another and
accomplishing more in just a few years than the rest accomplish in a lifetime.

If you should visit a ship in port and ask the captain for his next port of call, he’ll tell you in a single sentence. Even though the captain cannot see
his port, his destination for fully 99% of the voyage, he knows it’s there. And then, barring an unforeseen and highly unlikely catastrophe, he’ll reach
it. If someone asks you for your next port of call, your goal, could you tell him? Is your goal clean and concise in your mind? Do you have it written
down? It’s a good idea. We need reminding, reinforcement. If you can get a picture of your goal and stick it to your bathroom mirror, it’s an excellent
idea to do so. Thousands of successful people carry their goals written on a card in their wallets or purses.

When you ask people what they’re working for, chances are they’ll answer in vague generalities. They might say, “Oh, good health or happiness or lots of
money.” That’s not good enough. Good health should be a universal goal. We all want that, and do our best to achieve and maintain it. Happiness is a
byproduct of something else. And lots of money is much too vague. It might work, but I think it’s better to choose a particular sum of money. The better,
the clearer our goal is defined, the more real it becomes to us, and before long, the more attainable.

Happiness comes from the direction in which we’re moving. Children are happier on Christmas morning before opening their presents than they are Christmas
afternoon. No matter how wonderful their presents may be, it’s after Christmas. They’ll enjoy their gifts, to be sure, but we often find them querulous and
irritable Christmas afternoon. We’re happier on our way out to dinner than we are on the way home. We’re happier going on vacation than we are coming home
from it. And we’re happier moving toward our goals than even after they’ve been accomplished, believe it or not.

## Alex Hormozi - Closer Framework

- **Clarify why the prospect is there.**  - You need to identify what they need help with. No understanding = no sell.

- **Label the problem.** - What are they struggling with? What's not working? Then confirm you're on the same page. Without identifying the enemy, you cannot win the war.

- **Overview the prospect's pain.** - Ask what they've done in the past. Diagnose why it didn't work. Do this until you've gone through all their 
failures. This automatically positions you as the logical solution. 

- **Sell vacation to your prospect.** - Identify the top 3 things that will help. Explain why each is important to their success. Confirm they understand 
why each variable is essential. This helps them understand how you're going to actually get results.

- **Explain away the prospect's concerns.** - Overcome the three main objections. Blaming circumstances (Time, Money, Fit) Blaming others (Spouse, 
Partner, Kids, Employees) Blaming self (Avoiding the decision, extrapolating past to present)

- **Reinforce the prospect's decision.** Once they've paid, you need to prevent buyer's remorse. Give them a huge hit of dopamine to reaffirm their 
purchase.Ex: Personal videos, Handwritten cards, Swag Boxes, Personalized Onboarding, Timely communication within expectations, etc. When you reward 
people for buying, they respond by sticking around.

[ ALEX HORMOZI: 3 Traits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kbn4KA3SGls)

what makes a really good entrepreneur slash leader?

I think that they have to have the power to **influence.** They have to be able to move other people. They have to have **tremendous Drive**
whether that's a combination of towards or away so they have a big mission that they really want to achieve or they have some very big fear that they're running away from.
Either way I think the fuel works uh just from a pure entrepreneurship Perspective.

Third piece is **impulse control** is that they have to be able to say no to things on a regular basis for an extended period of time and I think they have to be able to boil
down the success of their business into inputs and outputs like if you do not know the inputs that are going to get the output that you want then what are you doing?

So I think for for most entrepreneurs like if they have those things if they have the ability to lead other people slash sell just influence they have some big motivator they can
control themselves long enough to keep on going during that period of time and they're doing the right things because they know the inputs and outputs to be successful to make their the thing
That they want becomes a very difficult person to be but I think that fundamentally is a skill that people have to have if they're going to be successful entrepreneurship 

in order to learn a skill you want to have as much exposure as you can to repeat the action and then you want quick feedback loops so that you can learn what you did wrong
so the perfect scenario would be Mentor mentee repeated exposure fix this try again fix this try again and in sales if you can survive that long then you are good enough

That you will have gotten enough feedback like for most people if they can weather the first three months of sales then they'll usually be fine and so for the people who are coming up
I always tell them like go Shadow the  best guy and do twice the volume he's doing because you're not as good as him so like do twice the volume that they're doing work all of the hours and you will
get better faster because you're doing you have to suck for X period of time and so if you can condense how how long that takes you in terms of calendar days not hours you can get there faster but I think 
that it's important because when you have to learn how to get rejected and still keep going and I think that's a very valuable skill and then two there's lots of like little things that you learn in just 
interpersonal communication that allow you that you can use with teammates later you can use in marketing because a lot of the best marketers started as salespeople and marketing is just sales one to many 
at least as as I understand it and so having that kind of repetition just develops a deep understanding of human psychology I think um and I think it's important for if you want to get people to give you 
money for the thing that you have um having that as a base skill comes in handy 

it's funny because a lot of us want traits right we want to be patient we want to be humble we want to be you know long-suffering whatever words you want to use but in order to if I would say hey how would 
you create if you had to create a human what would you put them through to make them tough it probably wouldn't be a really chill life would you put them through to make them patient well you probably 
wouldn't givethem things immediately and so it's like  we want these trades but each of the traits has a price tag attached to it it's just like do you want to pay the  price tag to get the thing and so I

***if people reframed the the period of life that they're going through as the price that they're paying out of their wallet but the wallet is their time it's the seconds of life that they're trading 
for it then I think more people be willing to make the trade***

Because at least when I look at myself like when I'm 80 something years old and I'm looking back on my life I want to add these traits but in order to have those trades I 
know I have to go through these things and I think for me that's given me a lot ofcomfort in hard times

## JK Molina

People don't go to social media to buy medicine. They go to social media to numb pain.

They know they could buy the medicine whenever. They know it can make the pain go away. But they'd rather numb it because the pain of inaction (scrolling) is smaller than the pain of action (buying).

That's the bad news.

The good news is that the deeper you bury the pain the more it hurts when you crack. 

And everyone cracks.
They'll go from pain-numbing mode to medicine-buying mode in an instant. Some have higher pain thresholds than others, but everyone gets there.

At that point the pain will be so high that they won't even want to think. They'll just buy the first medicine that pops in their mind.

Being the first medicine that pops in their mind - that's positioning.
