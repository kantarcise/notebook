## Steve Jobs - Letter For Me

The Letter:

"My passion has been to build an enduring company where people were motivated to make great products. **Everything else was secondary.** Sure, it was great to make a profit, because that was what allowed you to make great products. But the products, not the profits, were the motivation. Sculley flipped these priorities to where the goal was to make money. It’s a subtle difference, but it ends up meaning everything: the people you hire, who gets promoted, what you discuss in meetings.

Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.

Edwin Land of Polaroid talked about the intersection of the humanities and science. I like that intersection. There’s something magical about that place. There are a lot of people innovating, and that’s not the main distinction of my career. The reason Apple resonates with people is that there’s a deep current of humanity in our innovation. **I think great artists and great engineers are similar, in that they both have a desire to express themselves.** In fact some of the best people working on the original Mac were poets and musicians on the side. In the seventies computers became a way for people to express their creativity. Great artists like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were also great at science. Michelangelo knew a lot about how to quarry stone, not just how to be a sculptor.

People pay us to integrate things for them, because they don’t have the time to think about this stuff 24/7. If you have an extreme passion for producing great products, it pushes you to be integrated, to connect your hardware and your software and content management. You want to break new ground, so you have to do it yourself. If you want to allow your products to be open to other hardware or software, you have to give up some of your vision.

At different times in the past, there were companies that exemplified Silicon Valley. It was Hewlett-Packard for a long time. Then, in the semiconductor era, it was Fairchild and Intel. I think that it was Apple for a while, and then that faded. And then today, I think it’s Apple and Google—and a little more so Apple. I think Apple has stood the test of time. It’s been around for a while, but it’s still at the cutting edge of what’s going on.

It’s easy to throw stones at Microsoft. They’ve clearly fallen from their dominance. They’ve become mostly irrelevant. And yet I appreciate what they did and how hard it was. They were very good at the business side of things. They were never as ambitious product-wise as they should have been. Bill likes to portray himself as a man of the product, but he’s really not. He’s a businessperson. Winning business was more important than making great products. He ended up the wealthiest guy around, and if that was his goal, then he achieved it. But it’s never been my goal, and I wonder, in the end, if it was his goal. I admire him for the company he built—it’s impressive—and I enjoyed working with him. He’s bright and actually has a good sense of humor. But Microsoft never had the humanities and liberal arts in its DNA. Even when they saw the Mac, they couldn’t copy it well. They totally didn’t get it.

I have my own theory about why decline happens at companies like IBM or Microsoft. The company does a great job, innovates and becomes a monopoly or close to it in some field, and then the quality of the product becomes less important. The company starts valuing the great salesmen, because they’re the ones who can move the needle on revenues, not the product engineers and designers. So the salespeople end up running the company. John Akers at IBM was a smart, eloquent, fantastic salesperson, but he didn’t know anything about product. The same thing happened at Xerox. When the sales guys run the company, the product guys don’t matter so much, and a lot of them just turn off. It happened at Apple when Sculley came in, which was my fault, and it happened when Ballmer took over at Microsoft. Apple was lucky and it rebounded, but I don’t think anything will change at Microsoft as long as Ballmer is running it.

**I hate it when people call themselves “entrepreneurs” when what they’re really trying to do is launch a startup and then sell or go public, so they can cash in and move on. They’re unwilling to do the work it takes to build a real company, which is the hardest work in business.** That’s how you really make a contribution and add to the legacy of those who went before. You build a company that will still stand for something a generation or two from now. That’s what Walt Disney did, and Hewlett and Packard, and the people who built Intel. They created a company to last, not just to make money. That’s what I want Apple to be.

**I don’t think I run roughshod over people, but if something sucks, I tell people to their face. It’s my job to be honest. I know what I’m talking about, and I usually turn out to be right. That’s the culture I tried to create. We are brutally honest with each other, and anyone can tell me they think I am full of shit and I can tell them the same.** And we’ve had some rip-roaring arguments, where we are yelling at each other, and it’s some of the best times I’ve ever had. I feel totally comfortable saying “Ron, that store looks like shit” in front of everyone else. Or I might say “God, we really fucked up the engineering on this” in front of the person that’s responsible. That’s the ante for being in the room: You’ve got to be able to be super honest. Maybe there’s a better way, a gentlemen’s club where we all wear ties and speak in this Brahmin language and velvet code-words, but I don’t know that way, because I am middle class from California.
I was hard on people sometimes, probably harder than I needed to be. I remember the time when Reed was six years old, coming home, and I had just fired somebody that day, and I imagined what it was like for that person to tell his family and his young son that he had lost his job. It was hard. But somebody’s got to do it. **I figured that it was always my job to make sure that the team was excellent, and if I didn’t do it, nobody was going to do it.**

You always have to keep pushing to innovate. Dylan could have sung protest songs forever and probably made a lot of money, but he didn’t. He had to move on, and when he did, by going electric in 1965, he alienated a lot of people. His 1966 Europe tour was his greatest. He would come on and do a set of acoustic guitar, and the audiences loved him. Then he brought out what became The Band, and they would all do an electric set, and the audience sometimes booed. There was one point where he was about to sing “Like a Rolling Stone” and someone from the audience yells “Judas!” And Dylan then says, “Play it fucking loud!” And they did. The Beatles were the same way. They kept evolving, moving, refining their art. That’s what I’ve always tried to do—keep moving. Otherwise, as Dylan says, if you’re not busy being born, you’re busy dying.

What drove me? I think most creative people want to express appreciation for being able to take advantage of the work that’s been done by others before us. I didn’t invent the language or mathematics I use. I make little of my own food, none of my own clothes. Everything I do depends on other members of our species and the shoulders that we stand on. And a lot of us want to contribute something back to our species and to add something to the flow. It’s about trying to express something in the only way that most of us know how—because we can’t write Bob Dylan songs or Tom Stoppard plays. We try to use the talents we do have to express our deep feelings, to show our appreciation of all the contributions that came before us, and to add something to that flow. That’s what has driven me."

## Jensen Huang - Message for me

Your job is to make a unique contribution. Live a life of purpose. To do something that nobody else in the world would do or can do. 

To make a unique contribution. So that in the event, that after you are done, everybody says the world was better because you were here.

## David Whyte

An individual who asked a question [“what do I do when I'm lost in the forest?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yayx165hskU)

The Elder says “Stand still: the trees ahead and bushes beside you are not lost. Stand still.”

The trees ahead and the brushes beside you are not lost; wherever you are is called here and you must treat it as a powerful stranger.

The forest knows where you are you must let it find you. That poem is you can say there are three things in this poem you see that are absolutely clear. 

First of all the Elder says you cannot sleepwalk your way into your destiny you must wake up and pay attention. “Stand still the trees ahead and bushes beside you are not lost you must pay attention” Second stage is that in this in this teaching from the Elder there is this incredible feeling of Silence- That unless you have this Silence in your life (and you feel the silence in the poem when he says it), and I think what the Elder is saying there is that if you pay real attention- unless you have silence- an ability for silence in your body to do that- then you will get too frightened because all the voices inside you will drown out any real change. You’ll have a hundred reasons not to make any real change. 

You see and you've got all the voices and all the reasons not to do it and so the ability for profound silence is being called on here and then that attention can can flower into something else. 

The forest knows where you are you must let it find you.

“inch wide, mile deep” strategy.

We did everything wrong. 

We did not call them customers, they were our partners. 

We understood what they valued. Cyclists value the climb.

If we can capture the climb, give them a way to share this, that is the key.

We focused on engagement.

Customer based model.

[Substitute adventure for security.](https://youtu.be/g6VNAM58a_U?t=4932)

You are going to pursue security are you? How is that going to work ? You are going to die.

You do not want security. You are not an infant. You are after adventure.

So where is your adventure?

Aim up and tell the truth.

Adventure will come your way.

That is way better than security. There is no looking back. That is uncharted teritory.

If you want to be a different person. You need to behave a different way.

You want to step into the identity, so imagine how that person would act.

Someone offered you candy, you are trying to become a disciplined person.

Just say, I don't eat that. S/he will be like, "What is that mean, you always eat this."

Say "I used to eat it. I do not anymore."

You are teaching yourself and everyone else, how they should behave around you, every day.

[Slaying the Dragon Within Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjUkEj1O_0)

[There were dragons in the house.](https://youtu.be/REjUkEj1O_0?t=3110)

What happens when you go after the dragon? You get a piece of it.

You have absolutely everything you need. But you have to use all of it.

If you run away from any of it and in particular the parts of it that frighten you which you have endless reasons to run away from,
if you run away from any of it you dont get that piece of the dragon. If you miss even one piece there is a chink in your armor,
there is a piece you are vulnerable.

## Jordan Peterson - Aim

“What you aim at determines what you see” 

Aim down and your life will be limited to a low quality. Be aimless and randomly wander through life with no purpose.

Aim high, knowing where you are and where you want to go.

That’s where you’ll find true meaning.

Trying to actually ship a useful product that people like to large number of people is so insanely hard.
