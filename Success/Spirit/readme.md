## The Forgetting Curve

[The simple reason for reviews](https://methodsof.com/blog/the-ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve/)

The theory goes that, if you keep periodically re-learning (or refreshing your knowledge), the concept will have a better chance of sticking in your mind.

[Slaying the Dragon Within Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=REjUkEj1O_0)

[There were dragons in the house.](https://youtu.be/REjUkEj1O_0?t=3110)

What happens when you go after the dragon? You get a piece of it.

You have absolutely everything you need. But you have to use all of it.

If you run away from any of it and in particular the parts of it that frighten you which you have endless reasons to run away from,
if you run away from any of it you dont get that piece of the dragon. If you miss even one piece there is a chink in your armor,
there is a piece you are vulnerable.

“What you aim at determines what you see” 

Aim down and your life will be limited to a low quality. Be aimless and randomly wander through life with no purpose.

Aim high, knowing where you are and where you want to go.

That’s where you’ll find true meaning.

[Tesla AI Day 2020](https://youtu.be/ODSJsviD_SU?t=11979)

One of the hardest things to do, is to be useful. 

How many people did you help, how much help did you provide to each person on average?

Trying to actually ship a useful product that people like to large number of people is so insanely hard.

An average human looks without seeing, listens without hearing, touches without feeling, eats without tasting, moves without physical awareness, inhales without awareness of odour or fragrance, and talks without thinking.

[How to navigate life?](https://youtu.be/GBv0XLINAfs?t=2)

There are two things you need to know for navigating life.

Where are you? Precisely. What's good about you and what's bad about you?

The next is, where are you going?

Extra:  If you dare to do the most difficult thing you can conceptualize, your life will work out better than if you do anything else.
