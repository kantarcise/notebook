## This might be the **only** video that I ever need to keep training to be the best. 

Best version of myself.

"What are you doing when noone is looking?"

Starts at [9:04](https://youtu.be/L3tjaPZU3FE?t=543)

**"%99 of the time, I'm in this room alone."**

"No one, there to you, know slap me on on the ass and tell me "good job" like "nice pr" no."

"No, it's me telling myself "get the back on that treadmill get back on that row or start squatting again."

"You know anytime i'm sitting in between training sessions like just messing around on my phone it's me telling myself like:

"Put down your phone and get back the training, like you could be doing something productive right now like why are you just sitting here looking at looking at instagram."

"-Put your phone down go stretch, be productive (you know) better yourself instead." 

**"Yeah i mean that that's the stuff that i mean no one wants to see that."**

"It's not exciting uh it's not exciting to like walk into the gym and see me sitting on"

"the platform stretching for the third hour straight."

"Like who cares, but i mean that's what goes into it behind the scenes"
