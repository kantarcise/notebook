### Exploit Flywheels

The more authority you have:

- The higher prices you can charge
- The better your close rate becomes
- The more people seek you out instead of you chasing them
- The faster you can grow through referrals and word-of-mouth
- Which means you sign even more clients
- Which means you get even more results, and build your authority even higher.

It's the single biggest differentiator between agencies that stay small and those that scale to $100k/month and beyond, it's their commitment to building authority in their market
