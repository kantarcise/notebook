    "# Python implements elements as dynamic arrays in order to provide efficient random \n",
    "# access and support operations like indexing, slicing, and resizing. Dynamic arrays\n",
    "#  offer several advantages that make them suitable for the typical use cases of Python lists:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. Constant-time random access: Dynamic arrays allow constant-time access to elements\n",
    "#  based on their indices. This means that accessing an element at a specific index is fast, regardless \n",
    "# of the size of the array. This property is essential for many algorithms and operations that rely \n",
    "# on random access, such as indexing, slicing, and iterating over the elements.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. Efficient memory allocation: Dynamic arrays allocate memory in contiguous blocks, which allows\n",
    "#  for efficient memory management. Python lists dynamically resize by allocating a slightly larger\n",
    "#  block of memory when needed. This approach minimizes the frequency of memory reallocation, as\n",
    "#  resizing the array involves copying the existing elements to a new memory location.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. Low memory overhead: Python's dynamic arrays have a relatively low memory overhead compared \n",
    "# to other data structures like linked lists. Dynamic arrays store the elements themselves as well\n",
    "#  as additional metadata, such as the array size and capacity. This metadata allows for efficient\n",
    "#  indexing and resizing operations without consuming excessive memory.\n",
    "# \n",

    "# through 2i −1 have not yet been spent. Therefore, we have a valid amortization\n",

    "\n",
    "# Let's assume we charge x cyber-dollars for each append operation. Since growing the\n",
    "#  array from size k to size 2k costs 3k cyber-dollars, we can distribute this\n",
    "#  cost over the k append operations that caused the growth. Therefore, each of\n",
    "#  these k append operations will be charged an additional 3k/k = 3 cyber-dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, let's consider the other append operations that do not cause the array to grow\n",
    "# . According to the original proposition, we were charging 1 cyber-dollar for\n",
    "#  each of these operations. However, since we are overcharging these operations by 2 cyber-dollars,\n",
    "#  we need to reduce the charge for each of these operations to -1 cyber-dollar (to account for the overcharge).\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, the revised charge for each append operation can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "# - For append operations that cause the array to grow from size k to size 2k: x + 3 cyber-dollars\n",
    "# - For append operations that do not cause the array to grow: x - 1 cyber-dollar\n",
    "\n",
    "# To ensure the amortization works, we want the total charges collected from all the append operations to cover\n",
    "#  the costs of growing the array and the execution of all the operations. Since we\n",
