    "# Python implements elements as dynamic arrays in order to provide efficient random \n",
    "# access and support operations like indexing, slicing, and resizing. Dynamic arrays\n",
    "#  offer several advantages that make them suitable for the typical use cases of Python lists:\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 1. Constant-time random access: Dynamic arrays allow constant-time access to elements\n",
    "#  based on their indices. This means that accessing an element at a specific index is fast, regardless \n",
    "# of the size of the array. This property is essential for many algorithms and operations that rely \n",
    "# on random access, such as indexing, slicing, and iterating over the elements.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 2. Efficient memory allocation: Dynamic arrays allocate memory in contiguous blocks, which allows\n",
    "#  for efficient memory management. Python lists dynamically resize by allocating a slightly larger\n",
    "#  block of memory when needed. This approach minimizes the frequency of memory reallocation, as\n",
    "#  resizing the array involves copying the existing elements to a new memory location.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 3. Low memory overhead: Python's dynamic arrays have a relatively low memory overhead compared \n",
    "# to other data structures like linked lists. Dynamic arrays store the elements themselves as well\n",
    "#  as additional metadata, such as the array size and capacity. This metadata allows for efficient\n",
    "#  indexing and resizing operations without consuming excessive memory.\n",
    "# \n",
    "# 4. Cache locality: Dynamic arrays exhibit good cache locality, which means that accessing adjacent\n",

    "#  of iterating over the elements or performing operations on contiguous sections of the array.\n",

    "# Also, let us assume that growing the array from size k to size 2k requires k cyber-\n",

    "#  operation to ensure the amortization works.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let's assume we charge x cyber-dollars for each append operation. Since growing the\n",
    "#  array from size k to size 2k costs 3k cyber-dollars, we can distribute this\n",
    "#  cost over the k append operations that caused the growth. Therefore, each of\n",
    "#  these k append operations will be charged an additional 3k/k = 3 cyber-dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Now, let's consider the other append operations that do not cause the array to grow\n",
    "# . According to the original proposition, we were charging 1 cyber-dollar for\n",
    "#  each of these operations. However, since we are overcharging these operations by 2 cyber-dollars,\n",
    "#  we need to reduce the charge for each of these operations to -1 cyber-dollar (to account for the overcharge).\n",
    "\n",
    "# So, the revised charge for each append operation can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "# - For append operations that cause the array to grow from size k to size 2k: x + 3 cyber-dollars\n",
    "# - For append operations that do not cause the array to grow: x - 1 cyber-dollar\n",
    "\n",
    "# To ensure the amortization works, we want the total charges collected from all the append operations to cover\n",
    "#  the costs of growing the array and the execution of all the operations. Since we\n",
    "#  have n append operations, the total charges collected will be n * x.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Based on the proposition, we know that the total cost of executing n\n",
    "#  append operations is 3n cyber-dollars. Therefore, we have the equation:\n",

    "# When Bob wants to send Alice a message M on the Internet, he breaks M\n",

    "# into the network. When the packets arrive at Alice’s computer, they may\n",

    "# To efficiently assemble the sequence of n data packets in the correct order, Alice\n",
    "#  can use a priority queue (e.g., a min-heap) to keep track of the packets as\n",
    "#  they arrive. Each packet should be labeled with its packet number, allowing Alice \n",
    "# to identify the correct order once all packets have been received.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Here's a step-by-step description of the algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Alice initializes an empty priority queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. As each packet arrives, she inserts it into the priority queue, using\n",
    "#  the packet number as the priority key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Alice repeatedly extracts packets from the priority queue until\n",
    "#  it is empty, which automatically sorts the packets in ascending order based on their packet numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4. The packets extracted from the priority queue form the message M in the correct order.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Since Alice uses a priority queue to sort the packets, the time complexity of\n",
    "#  this algorithm is O(n log n). This is because inserting each packet into the\n",
    "#  priority queue takes O(log n) time, and she needs to insert n packets.\n",
    "#  Additionally, extracting n packets from the priority queue also takes O(n log n) time.\n",
    "#  Therefore, the overall running time of the algorithm is O(n log n), which \n",
