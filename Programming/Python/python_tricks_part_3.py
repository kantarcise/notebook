# Lambdas Are Single-Expression Functions

# The lambda keyword in Python provides a shortcut for declaring
# small anonymous functions. Lambda functions behave just like
# regular functions declared with the def keyword. They can be used
# whenever function objects are required.

add_numbers = lambda x, y: x + y
add_numbers(5, 3)
# 8
