# Defining Your Own Exception Classes

# When I started using Python, I was hesitant to write custom exception
# classes in my code. But defining your own error types can be of great
# value. Youâ€™ll make potential error cases stand out clearly, and as a
# result, your functions and modules will become more maintainable.

# You can also use custom error types to provide additional debugging information.
