# How functions work in Python and why they’re beneficial
# How to define and call your own Python function
# Mechanisms for passing arguments to your function
# How to return data from your function back to the calling environment

# Here is a unusual intro:

# In life, you do this sort of thing all the time, even if you don’t explicitly think of it that way. If you wanted to move 
# some shelves full of stuff from one side of your garage to the other, then you 
# hopefully wouldn’t just stand there and aimlessly think, 
# “Oh, geez. I need to move all that stuff over there! How do I do that???”
# You’d divide the job into manageable steps:

#     Take all the stuff off the shelves.
#     Take the shelves apart.
#    Carry the shelf parts across the garage to the new location.
#     Re-assemble the shelves.
#     Carry the stuff across the garage.
#     Put the stuff back on the shelves.

# Breaking a large task into smaller, bite-sized sub-tasks helps 
# make the large task easier to think about and manage. As programs become more 
# complicated, it becomes increasingly beneficial to modularize them in this way.
