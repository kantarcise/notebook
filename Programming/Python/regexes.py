# Rather than searching for a fixed substring like '123', 
# suppose you wanted to determine whether a string contains any three consecutive
# decimal digit characters, as in the strings 'foo123bar', 'foo456bar', '234baz', and 'qux678'.

# Strict character comparisons wonâ€™t cut it here. This is where regexes in Python come to the rescue.
