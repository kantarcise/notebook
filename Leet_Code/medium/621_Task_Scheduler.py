"""
You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters 
A to Z, and a cooling time, n. 

Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. 

Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical 
tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.

â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.

Example 1:

    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
    Output: 8
    Explanation: 
      A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

      After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing 
        A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither 
        A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do 
        A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:

    Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
    Output: 6
    Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
        With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just 
        one other task.

Example 3:

    Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: A possible sequence 
        is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

    There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be 
      separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between 
      repetitions of these tasks.

Constraints:

    1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
    tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
    0 <= n <= 100

Takeaway:

    RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration

    We can use heaps and deques
