"""
We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done 
from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].

You're given the startTime, endTime and profit arrays, return the 
maximum profit you can take such that there are no two jobs in 
the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able 
to start another job that starts at time X.

Example 1:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

Example 2:

Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

Example 3:
Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6
 
Constraints:

1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length == profit.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= 109
1 <= profit[i] <= 104

Takeaway:

bisect provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order 
without having to sort the list after each insertion.

bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a), *, key=None)
Locate the insertion point for x in a to maintain sorted order.

bisect.insort_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a), *, key=None)
Insert x in a in sorted order.

bisect.bisect(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a), *, key=None)Â¶
Similar to bisect_left(), but returns an insertion point which 
comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of x in a.

        # For each job = [s, e, p], where s,e,p are its start time, end time and profit,
