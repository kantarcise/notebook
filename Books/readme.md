(Airbnb's Brian Chesky - "You only need to read one book on management.")

Still Reading.

## 0) Introduction: 

- Companies today basically have 2 choices. Adapt or Die.

- As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your grop's performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit.

- All employess produce in some sense, some make chips while others make software or make advertising copy.

- The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.

- One of the fundementals tenet's of Intel's managerial philosophy is the one-on-one meeting between the supervisor and the subordinate. It's main purpose are mutual educatşon and exchange of information.

- No matter where you work, you are not an employee - you are in a business with one employee; yourself.

- So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competetive advantage.

- Every day you must enhance your value, hone in your competitive advantage, learn, adapt, get out of the way, move from job to job, even industry to industry if you must retrench if you need to do so in order to do it again.

Here is a 3 question approach:

- Are you adding real value or merely passing information along? Are you continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department?

- Are you a node connected to a network of plugged-in people or are you floating by yourself?

- Are you trying new ideas and new technologies? I don't mean reading about them, I mean personally trying them.

## 0) Introduction

How can you save the world? By helping every individual to improve and helping them to be heroes.

## 1) "Stand up straight with your shoulders back."

“To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the responsibility of life, with eyes 
wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable
order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the
unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It
means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality.”

Humans have a dominance detector in our brain. How we perceive our social/economic status affects
our well-being which reinforces our status in a positive feedback loop.

• People with strong self-esteem feel/transmit a sense of security and confidence, which makes
them more attractive and respected. This improves their productivity and well-being, which further
reinforces their self-perception. Higher serotonin levels are associated with greater
resilience, happiness, health, lifespan, pro-social behavior and leadership.

• On the other hand, people with a low self-perception feel insecure. They’re more likely to
be stressed, jumpy and reactive. They make poor decisions, fail to command respect/resources, which
reinforce their loser complex.

In short, our self-perception affects the vibes we transmit to create a self-reinforcing loop.
If you feel like a loser for whatever reason, the first step is to break the negative cycle by 
correcting your posture.

• Don’t slouch. It conveys defeat and a low status, which prompts others to treat 
you poorly and reinforce your low self-perception.

• Fix your posture. Stand straight, push your shoulders back, speak up and make eye contact. 
This signals confidence to yourself and others. You’ll feel better, others will show you more
respect, and it starts a virtuous cycle. It’s about standing tall, facing up to reality and 
taking responsibility to become all you can be.

## 2) "Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping."


## 3) "Make friends with people who want the best for you."


## 4) "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today."


## 5) "Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them."


## 6) "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world."


## 7) "Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)."


## 8) "Tell the truth – or, at least, don't lie."


## 9) "Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't."


## 10) "Be precise in your speech."


## 11) "Do not bother children while they are skateboarding."


## 12) "Pet a cat when you encounter one in the street."
