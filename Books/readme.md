(Airbnb's Brian Chesky - "You only need to read one book on management.")

Still Reading.

## 0) Introduction: 

- Companies today basically have 2 choices. Adapt or Die.

- As a micro CEO, you can improve your own and your grop's performance and productivity, whether or not the rest of the company follows suit.

- All employess produce in some sense, some make chips while others make software or make advertising copy.

- The output of a manager is the output of the organizational units under his or her supervision or influence.

- One of the fundementals tenet's of Intel's managerial philosophy is the one-on-one meeting between the supervisor and the subordinate. It's main purpose are mutual educatşon and exchange of information.

- No matter where you work, you are not an employee - you are in a business with one employee; yourself.

- So if you want to work and continue to work, you must continually dedicate yourself to retaining your individual competetive advantage.

- Every day you must enhance your value, hone in your competitive advantage, learn, adapt, get out of the way, move from job to job, even industry to industry if you must retrench if you need to do so in order to do it again.

Here is a 3 question approach:

- Are you adding real value or merely passing information along? Are you continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department?

- Are you a node connected to a network of plugged-in people or are you floating by yourself?

- Are you trying new ideas and new technologies? I don't mean reading about them, I mean personally trying them.

## 0) Introduction

How can you save the world? By helping every individual to improve and helping them to be heroes.

## 1) "Stand up straight with your shoulders back."

“To stand up straight with your shoulders back is to accept the responsibility of life, with eyes 
wide open. It means deciding to voluntarily transform the chaos of potential into the realities of habitable
order. It means adopting the burden of self-conscious vulnerability, and accepting the end of the
unconscious paradise of childhood, where finitude and mortality are only dimly comprehended. It
means willingly undertaking the sacrifices necessary to generate a productive and meaningful reality.”

Humans have a dominance detector in our brain. How we perceive our social/economic status affects
our well-being which reinforces our status in a positive feedback loop.

• People with strong self-esteem feel/transmit a sense of security and confidence, which makes
them more attractive and respected. This improves their productivity and well-being, which further
reinforces their self-perception. Higher serotonin levels are associated with greater
resilience, happiness, health, lifespan, pro-social behavior and leadership.

• On the other hand, people with a low self-perception feel insecure. They’re more likely to
be stressed, jumpy and reactive. They make poor decisions, fail to command respect/resources, which
reinforce their loser complex.

In short, our self-perception affects the vibes we transmit to create a self-reinforcing loop.
If you feel like a loser for whatever reason, the first step is to break the negative cycle by 
correcting your posture.

• Don’t slouch. It conveys defeat and a low status, which prompts others to treat 
you poorly and reinforce your low self-perception.

• Fix your posture. Stand straight, push your shoulders back, speak up and make eye contact. 
This signals confidence to yourself and others. You’ll feel better, others will show you more
respect, and it starts a virtuous cycle. It’s about standing tall, facing up to reality and 
taking responsibility to become all you can be.

## 2) "Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping."


## 3) "Make friends with people who want the best for you."


## 4) "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today."


## 5) "Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them."


## 6) "Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world."


## 7) "Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)."


## 8) "Tell the truth – or, at least, don't lie."


## 9) "Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't."


## 10) "Be precise in your speech."


## 11) "Do not bother children while they are skateboarding."


## 12) "Pet a cat when you encounter one in the street."

Technology is miraculous because it allows us to do more with less, ratcheting up our fundamental
capabilities to a higher level. Other animals are instinctively driven to build things like dams or
honeycombs, but we are the only ones that can invent new things and better ways of making them.

This book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012. 

## 1 The Challenge of the Future

***“What important truth do very few people agree with you on?”***

My answers:

    Discipline is freedom.
    You can gamify every single responsibility you have.
    What you most want to be found will be found where you least want to look.
    Physical Training is one of the best dopamine source.
    Delayed gratification is the key to success.
    Noone needs 3 meals a day. 
    Breakfast is a propoganda.

***Vertical vs Horizontal Progress:***

When we think about the future, we hope for a future of progress. That progress can take one of two
forms. Horizontal or extensive progress means copying things that work—going from 1 to n.
Horizontal progress is easy to imagine because we already know what it looks like. Vertical or
intensive progress means doing new things—going from 0 to 1. Vertical progress is harder to imagine
because it requires doing something nobody else has ever done. If you take one typewriter and build
100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you
have made vertical progress.

## 2 Party Like It’s 1999

***Story of Paypal***

By the fall of ’99, our email payment product worked well—anyone could log in to our website
and easily transfer money. But we didn’t have enough customers, growth was slow, and expenses
mounted. For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users.
Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling
through. So we decided to pay people to sign up.

We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a
friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate. Of
course, this customer acquisition strategy was unsustainable on its own—when you pay people to be
your customers, exponential growth means an exponentially growing cost structure. Crazy costs were
typical at that time in the Valley. But we thought our huge costs were sane: given a large user base,
PayPal had a clear path to profitability by taking a small fee on customers’ transactions.

## 3 All Happy Companies Are Different

***what valuable company is nobody building?***

Monopoly businesses vs perfect competition.

## 4 The Ideology of Competition

***What really is competition?***

This is a simple truth, but we’ve all been trained to ignore it. Our educational system both drives
and reflects our obsession with competition. Grades themselves allow precise measurement of each
student’s competitiveness; pupils with the highest marks receive status and credentials. We teach
every young person the same subjects in mostly the same ways, irrespective of individual talents and
preferences. Students who don’t learn best by sitting still at a desk are made to feel somehow
inferior, while children who excel on conventional measures like tests and assignments end up
defining their identities in terms of this weirdly contrived academic parallel reality

## 5 Last Mover Advantage

EScaping competition will give you a monopoly, but even a monopoly is only a great business if it can
endure in the future. Compare the value of the New York Times Company with Twitter. Each employs
a few thousand people, and each gives millions of people a way to get news. But when Twitter went
public in 2013, it was valued at $24 billion—more than 12 times the Times’s market capitalization
—even though the Times earned $133 million in 2012 while Twitter lost money. What explains the
huge premium for Twitter?

The answer is cash flow. This sounds bizarre at first, since the Times was profitable while Twitter
wasn’t. But a great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. Investors
expect Twitter will be able to capture monopoly profits over the next decade, while newspapers’
monopoly days are over.

## 6 You Are Not a Lottery Ticket

If you believe your life is mainly a matter of chance, why read this book? Learning about startups is
worthless if you’re just reading stories about people who won the lottery. Slot Machines for
Dummies can purport to tell you which kind of rabbit’s foot to rub or how to tell which machines are
“hot,” but it can’t tell you how to win.

...

A definite view, by contrast, favors firm convictions. Instead of pursuing many-sided mediocrity
and calling it “well-roundedness,” a definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does
it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something
substantive—to be a monopoly of one. This is not what young people do today, because everyone
around them has long since lost faith in a definite world.

...

To a definite optimist, the future will be better than the present if he plans and works to make it
better.

To an indefinite optimist, the future will be better, but he doesn’t know how
exactly, so he won’t make any specific plans. He expects to profit from the future but sees no reason
to design it concretely.

...

But they miss the even bigger social context for their own preferred explanations: a whole generation
learned fromchildhood to overrate the power of chance and underrate the importance of planning. Gladwell at first
appears to be making a contrarian critique of the myth of the self-made businessman, but actually his
own account encapsulates the conventional view of a generation.

...

A startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery. You can have agency
not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the
unjust tyranny of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.
